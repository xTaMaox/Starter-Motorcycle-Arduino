arduino uno
relay 4 chanel
module bluetooth HC 05
jumper cable male to female
usb

first we connect the relay, we plug the relay with the jumper cable
relay -- arduino
VCC To 5V
GND To GND
IN1 To D11
IN2 To D10
IN3 To D9
IN4 To D8

then connect the jumper cable that is already connected to the relay to the Arduino
then we also connect the bluetooth module with the jumper cable, we only use 4 ports in the middle,
for the right and left sides, we just leave it alone, no need to install the cable then we attach it to the arduino
bluetooth -- arduino
VCC To 3.3V
GND To GND
RXD To RX-0
TXD To TX-1
for RXD and TXD it can be changed if for example if it can't work and the RXD, TXD can also be reversed

then the next step is to upload the program, we use a laptop here
then we plug the port into usb, after arriving here we make sure the arduino is on, that's a sign that it's connected
the next step we open the arduino ID to upload the program after that we can see here already
open the program, before we upload the program, don't forget we have to remove the TXD and RXD so that
there will be no error during uploading
after that we just compliling the data, we just wait a moment and counseling, there are no disk errors
what we made and then we just upload the program
after we wait for a while our relay light has been successfully lit, that's a sign that the program we made is working well
we see that the bluetooth is also flashing because it has not been connected, then we plug the TXD and RXD cables back into the Arduino
as before, the next step we do a test step first before we attach it to the motorbike
for the experiment, we have provided an android cellphone that has the bluetooth application installed, so far we can still do it
see the bluetooth module is still flashing, that's a sign that bluetooth is still not connected to android
now we try to just open the android application after opening the application we are asked to turn on the bluetooth
when the bluetooth on the android phone is turned on then we click the bluetooth icon, because the bluetooth is not connected, we open it
just the bluetooth icon on the android phone and when the device is found we just enter the password,
here the password is usually 1234 / 0000 then back, after that we enter the application again and click the blueooth icon and we
connect the bluetooth device then we connect it directly, until here we can detect bluetooth is already connected to
the light is on and doesn't flash, it's a sign that bluetooth is connected
after that we just do a test step with the command by pressing the button or microphone icon in the application
we try to do a command for example by saying "turn on the contact" then we can also see the relay light turns off when we
Doing that command is a sign that this application is working

after that we just attach the circuit to the motor and of course attach it in stepdown to become a current retainer from the battery
because I gave the voltage supply from the battery, then we just tested it via Android. Immediately we give orders through the application
bluetooth that we have installed, we open it then we directly connect the device with bluetooth on our android cellphone, before we start with
by giving the command and we position the motor is off, we just give the command for example "turn on the contact" then "turn on the engine" and after
That's why we make sure everything goes well following our orders, it's also best when we start doing orders the surroundings must be quiet
because the device is likely to detect sounds around you. After everything is done properly and correctly, we can confirm our project
kai this can be said to be successf
